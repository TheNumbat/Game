# Game

A game development project inspired by games like The Binding of Isaac.  

Currently most of a simple 2D engine is implemented (audio, video, file IO, input, logging, threading, timing, entities, world storage, some physics, rendering, and debug profiling), but the project is on hold.  
The 'new' branch contains two visual studio projects that should be buildable.  
The 'old' branch (since refactored/rewritten) has doxygen documentation describing the engine setup.

Libraries Used:

SDL 2.0  
SDL_Image  
SDL_Mixer  
SDL_ttf  
Dirent
