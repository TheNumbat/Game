# Game

A game development project inspired by games like The Binding of Isaac.  

Currently most of a simple 2D engine is implemented, but the project is on hold.  
The 'new' branch contains two visual studio projects that should be buildable.  
The 'old' branch (since refactored/rewritten) has doxygen documentation describing the engine setup.

Libraries Used:

SDL 2.0  
SDL_Image  
SDL_Mixer  
SDL_ttf  
Dirent
